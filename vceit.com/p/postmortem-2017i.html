 <p align="left"><strong>Zombie Pursuit</strong><br />
   Zombie Pursuit is a small entertainment facility on the outskirts of Melbourne. Its owners, Flynn and Elena, have converted a warehouse into a multistorey, escape-room-style facility where customers pay to fight zombies. Customers can choose to play in groups of up to 10 and can arm themselves with laser weapons. Although only one game can be played at a time, three different types of games are offered during the week. Prior to entering the playing area, customers are required to register their details on the Zombie Pursuit website and choose a unique nickname. This ensures their details are saved to the Zombie Pursuit database. They are then issued with their weapon and told the basic rules of the game:<br />
   &bull; If you zap a zombie, it is out of the game and you get points.<br />
   &bull; If a zombie splats green gloop on you, you get 'eaten', which means your weapon is inactive for 60 seconds and you lose points.<br />
   &bull; Physical violence against the zombies is strictly prohibited.<br />
   Zombie Pursuit currently has 30 employees consisting of 25 actors who play the zombies, two cleaners, one party host and two food and beverage attendants.</p>
 <p align="left"><br />
   <strong>Issue</strong><br />
   At present, Zombie Pursuit's website just provides visitors with information about Zombie Pursuit. Currently all bookings are done via the telephone.<br />
   Elena would like to modify the company's website so that customers can see available time slots, make a booking and pay in advance.<br />
   One of the actors, Anthony, is currently completing a Master of Business degree at university and is required to complete a research project as part of his course. Anthony has a hypothesis: 'Increasing the competition between customers will increase the number of customers because competition creates enthusiasm and excitement. '<br />
   Anthony thinks that one way to increase competition between Zombie Pursuit's customers would be to create a monthly contest where the players with the five best scores from that month are invited back to create a 'super team' and take on the zombies. The highest scorer from that team then wins a prize.<br />
   Flynn gives Anthony permission to use the company as part of his research project. For the first part of the project, the university requires Anthony to submit his hypothesis and evidence that supports or refutes it in a multimodal online report. The report is due in June and, if it does not provide a clear, well-argued and evidenced-based conclusion, Anthony will not be able to proceed with the rest of his project.</p>
 <p align="left">   <strong>Zombie Pursuit's information system</strong><br />
   The information system is built around a local area network (LAN) connecting:<br />
   &bull; a fileserver, which holds the company's database and all other important records, and has a DVD burner attached to it<br />
   &bull;  two desktop computers, with attached printers, that are used for all administrative tasks<br />
   &bull;  two tablet computers that are used by customers to register themselves and choose a nickname.<br />
   The physical layout of the LAN and other components and features is shown in the diagram below.</p>
 <p align="left"><br />
   <img src="../m/pm/17i-casestudy.gif" width="800" height="441" alt="Informatics exam 2017"/><br />
 </p>
 <p><strong>Zombie Pursuit's current information management practices</strong><br />
   &bull; Backup procedure<br />
   The fileserver is never shut down. It automatically runs a backup every night at midnight. This is achieved by copying all the important files onto a DVD. Each evening, before leaving for home, Elena replaces the previous night's backup DVD with a blank. She stores the backup DVD in a locked cupboard in the office and then goes home.<br />
   &bull; Disposal procedure<br />
   To save on cupboard space, Elena only keeps the 10 most recent backup DVDs. When she places the latest backup DVD in the cupboard, she removes the oldest one and puts it into the office's rubbish bin.<br />
   &bull; Software security controls<br />
   The fileserver runs an antivirus program. The program scans any file when the file is opened and is also scheduled to run a full virus scan at 2 am every morning. Before running the scan, the antivirus program automatically checks for updates to the virus definitions.<br />
   The two desktop computers have no virus detection software installed.<br />

<p align="left">Elena has started creating a mock-up of a new web page using a simple drawing program. The purpose of the web page is to allow customers to make a booking online. She has printed her mock-up and written annotations in brackets on it. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="../m/pm/17i-c08.gif" width="600" height="905" alt="Informatics exam 2017"/></p>
<p align="left">She still has to add controls that meet the following three requirements:<br />
1. Obtain the number of people (minimum one, maximum 10).<br />
2. Obtain a contact number (must be entered) and email address (optional).<br />
3. Allow a customer to proceed to payment if all of the required data has been entered.<br />
a. Complete Elena's mock-up on page 21 so that it shows the controls needed to meet the three requirements listed above. When drawing the controls:<br />
&bull; clearly indicate the type of control with an annotation<br />
&bull;  make sure the purpose of the control is clear<br />
&bull;  take into account the web page's appearance.<br />
b. By referring to appropriate design principles related to functionality, justify the type of control used to meet requirement 1.</p>

<p align="left">Flynn and Anthony have constructed the database tables needed to run the player competition.<br />
Anthony is constructing a number of queries that will extract the required information. He represents the design of the queries using input-process-output (IPO) charts.<br />
a. Anthony would like one of the competitions to be only for players who are under 18 years of age on 1 January of the current year. The IPO chart below shows a query that he will use to filter out any player who is too old.	2	marks<br />

<p>b. To create a 'super team', Anthony needs a query that returns each player's score for a game.<br />
In each game, players get five points for every zombie they zap, but lose 10 points every time they are 'eaten'.<br />
Complete the process column in the IPO chart below by showing what the query needs to do<br />

   <p align="left">Isha's store has been in operation for a number of years. In that time, she has had many customers, suppliers and product lines. To prevent her records from becoming cluttered with out-of-date data, in July each year Isha deletes any records of customers, suppliers or product lines that have not been accessed for five years. Isha's computer is kept in an office at the back of the store and is rarely turned off. It is connected to the internet by a simple broadband modem. Isha runs a complete virus scan on her computer every week.<br />
For each of the areas of information management shown below, decide who (Zombie Pursuit or Isha) has the more effective procedures and justify your answer.<br />

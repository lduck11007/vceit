This problem comes from the 2000 end of year IPM exam. It has been roundly 
criticised for its difficulty and vagueness. Let's see what we can do with 
it.<br />

<p><i>&quot;Hopeful Secondary College School Council decided at its last 
meeting that a new computer laboratory was required. The project commenced 
on Monday 16 October. The plan for the process and its progress are shown 
in the diagram above. The school council has decided to manage to refurbishment 
of the room and is required to have the room completed by Friday 22 December. 
Due to class requirements, the commencement of alterations to the classroom 
cannot commence before Monday 11 December.&quot;</i></p>

First: this Gantt chart was produced using <b>Microsoft Project</b>. This 
is a common tool for producing Gantt charts, but it is only one way of 
doing so: other charts may look a bit different.</p>
<p>Look at the time scale at the top of the chart. Notice anything odd? 
Yes, folks. The minor date scale (under the line beginning &quot;16 Oct 
'00&quot;) shows every <i>fourth</i> day. Makes it much harder to read. 
Heaven knows why the examiners did it (I can guess: it was the only way 
they could get it to fit onto the printed page.) </p>
<p>Anyway, just <i>remember to always check the time scale</i> before interpreting 
a chart.</p>
<p>The major scale is in units of fortnights (the first step is 16 Oct, 
the next is the 30th - 14 days apart.) The dotty lines going down the 
chart mark beginnings of major time units. e.g. task 8 begins on the dotty 
line that marks the beginning of major unit beginning December 11 so you 
can easily tell it starts on Dec 11.</p>
<p>There are 13 tasks, listed downwards in the left column.</p>
<p>The blue bars graphically show the length of each task (which is also 
visible numerically in column 2)</p>
<p>The arrows from the end of one task to the beginning of another mean 
the second task must wait for the first task to end before the second 
can begin. This is called a &quot;dependency&quot;. The earlier task is 
called the &quot;predecessor&quot;.</p>
<p>Most tasks follow each other in a &quot;lock-step&quot; manner until 
you reach tasks 10 and 11 which overlap: overlapping bars mean the tasks 
can be carried out concurrently (at the same time.)</p>
<p> Both tasks 10 and 11 are dependent on task 9. Task 11 starts on the 
same day as task 10 and lasts one workday longer.</p>
<p> Notice however that task 10's bar is a fair bit shorter than task 11's 
even though they are only one workday different: this is because task 
11 spans a weekend, so its bar is actually 5 days long <i>even though 
no work is done on the weekend</i>.</p>
<p>The diamonds show <i>milestones</i>. Milestones are significant points 
of progress in the project. They have zero length: no work is actually 
needed for a milestone. They mark major points of project development.</p>
<p>The black lines in the bars of the first 3 tasks indicate how much of 
the task has been completed so far. You can see tasks 1 and 2 are finished 
and task 3 is half-finished. This lets a project manager keep track of 
where the project is actually up to.</p>

<p><b>Quick question 1</b>: When does the project start? </p>
<p><b>Answer</b>: 16 October (see where task 1's bar begins on the dotty 
line that starts off &quot;16 Oct&quot;)</p>
<p><b>Quick question 2</b>: When does the project end?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>: 21 December (the milestone is dated so you can easily 
tell) [actually, I believe the milestone is wrong - <a href="#milestonewrong">see 
below</a>]</p>
<p><b>Quick question 3</b>: The exam questions below are worth a total of 
5 marks: how long should you spend on them?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>: For 2003 and beyond, the exam is worth 90 marks and you 
have 120 minutes, therefore 1.333 minutes per mark.</p>

<h4>Exam Question 1: What is the first milestone in this project? (1 mark)</h4>
</td>

This is an easy one: it's the first diamond you can find, which is <i>task

<h4>Exam Question 2: How much 'slack' time is there after commencement of 
the alterations, including weekends? (1)</h4>
</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
<td> 
<p><br />
First let's find when the alterations commence: this is task 8, &quot;Prepare 
site&quot; on 11/12/00.</p>
<p>Now let's mentally expand the time scale (you could mark the days off 
with a pen). Note that while task 11's bar spans the weekend and is 5 
days long in total, only 3 of the days are work days.</p>
<p><img src= "../m/gantt-pert-gantt9b.gif" width="638" height="144" /></p>
<p>Let's find the critical path, starting at task 8: what is the longest 
possible path of tasks until the end? Tasks 8,9,11,12 add up to 1+2+3+1=7 
days.</p>
<p>The alternate path (since tasks 10 and 11 overlap) is Tasks 8,9,10,12 
adding up to 1+2+2+1=6 days.</p>
<p>So, there is a 1 day difference between the paths BUT the question adds 
&quot;including weekends.&quot; So, if task 10 really got in trouble, 
and they needed all the time they could muster without affecting the finish 
date, they could work the weekend as well, giving them <b><i>3 slack days</i></b> 
maximum.</p>
<p>Another way to approach it is to just looking at where the 2 tasks diverge 
(14 Dec) until the point they converge to a single path again at task 
12 on 19 Dec (the same technique used in the <a href="gantt-pert-pert-tute.html">PERT 
chart tutorial</a>) The shorter path [task 10] is 2 days and the longer 
path [task 11] is 3 days - a one day difference. Add on the weekend as 
potential working time, as the question says, and the slack is 3 days.</p>
<p>(If you look at the original printed exam, it is VERY hard to read any 
detail from it and teachers have given the examiners detention for this. 
If there is a Gantt chart in the next exam, it must be easier to read 
than the one in 2000: it couldn't be worse!)</p>

<h4>Exam Question 3: The supplier of the cable has just informed you that

<p>THIS DISCUSSION IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW ONCE I WORK OUT WHERE THE BIG APPARENT 
PROBLEM IS!<br />
<br />
The examiners' answer to this question was a mess. They ended up accepting 
3 different answers, because many students interpreted &quot;end date&quot; 
differently.</p>
<p>Their official <a href="http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/VCE/ASSESS/REPORTS/00cycle2/exams/ip_man/index.htm" target="_top">answer</a> 
was: &quot;'[<i>The end date would be delayed by</i>] <i>1 day - cabling 
will now start on Tuesday 19th not Monday 18th but project is still able 
to be completed on time' </i><b>or</b><i> 'nothing' </i><b>or</b><i> 'end 
date will be delayed by one day' </i><b>or</b><i> 'end date will still 
be met'.</i>&quot; </p>
<p>Now call me a rebel, but I think this answer is a pile of fetid dingo's 
kidneys. How can it make sense?</p>
<p>Here's the end of the Gantt chart in more detail:</p>
<p><img src= "../m/gantt-pert-gantt9b.gif" width="638" height="144" /></p>
<p>Let's take it step by step...</p>

<p><a name="milestonewrong"></a>1. According to my calculations, the Gantt 
chart's final milestone is wrong. It is marked 21 Dec, but it should be 
on the 20th.</p>
<p>2. Since the cabling should have started on the 14th of December (not 
the 18th as the examiners' answer claims), a delivery delay causing installation 
to start on December 19th would make the end of the Gantt chart look like 
this:</p>
<p><img src= "../m/gantt-pert-gantt-fixed.gif" width="617" height="145" /> </p>
<p>Therefore, the finishing date of the project would have changed from 
end end of Tuesday 19 Dec to the end of Friday 22 Dec - a total of THREE 
days' delay to the 'end date', if you interpret 'end date' as the original 
planned finishing day: December 19.</p>
<p>If you interpreted 'end date' as the date the room had to be finished 
by (Dec 22 in the case study), there is <i>no change</i> to the 'end date'.</p>
<p>This fuzzy definition of 'end date' was the reason the examiners ended 
up with a bag of acceptable answers to the question.</p>
<p>Anyway, the examiners accepted 3 different answers (not including mine 
above.) I still think mine is valid, if interpreting 'end date' as 'original 
expected finishing date' (Dec 19).</p>
<p><b>I would be VERY grateful if any smart bunnies out there could <a href="../wp/contact-me-at-vceit-com-2/index.html">alert 
me</a> to faults in my theory about this question!</b></p>

<h4>Exam Question 4: What options would a project manager have if the cable

</h4>
</td>

<tr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This answer has <i>nothing to do with the Gantt chart</i>: it is a common 
question to test common sense. It is really asking, &quot;How could a 
task be hurried up?&quot; Expect this type of question and remember that 
it is not related to the Gantt chart you are given for the other questions.</p>
<p>The sorts of things you can do are: </p>
<ul>
<li>work 24 hours a day; </li>
<li>bring in more workers; </li>
<li>reduce the time taken on other tasks (such as cable testing); </li>
<li>improve work efficiency (e.g. use an electric screwdriver to tighten 
screws rather than using a manual screwdriver or replace inexperienced 
workers with skilled and experienced staff who would work faster.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods that 'cut corners' and affect the quality of the work are not 
recommended! Suggestion 3 above (cutting down on testing time) is perilously 
close to 'cutting corners.'<br />

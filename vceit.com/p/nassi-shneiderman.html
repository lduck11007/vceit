<p >A tool that we use almost exclusively to design the processes that make 
up our systems is the Nassi-Shneiderman chart. An alternative to the 
overly flexible flow chart, NS charts enforce structure and modularity 
in the programming process. An excellent NS charting tool is available 
that makes the use of NS charts quite painless. This white paper describes 
NS charts and illustrates their advantage in the modern world of structured 
programming.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText> We all give lip service to “structured design techniques” 
but how many of us are true disciples? Even worse, how do we control a 
programming group faced with impossible schedules when getting something 
– anything – to demonstrate quickly to management is the top priority 
item? Wouldn’t it be nice to have a design tool that enforced structure? 
That is what this paper is about.</p>
<p> The first key to building a well-structured system, of course, is to 
design the system before building it. Can you imagine your anger at an 
architect who directs a contractor to build the kitchen and living room 
of your new home only to find out there is no wall space left for a door 
to the bedroom? Yet we often seem to build software systems in this piecemeal 
fashion. I often hear the excuse “We don’t have time to design.” I submit 
that any system will be put into operation faster if it is designed properly 
in the first place. If you don’t have time to design, then you certainly 
don’t have time <em>not</em> to design.</p>
<p> Given the acceptance of proper design, we now can turn our attention 
to design tools. A good design tool should:</p>
<ul>
<li> Enforce structured design.</li>
<li>Enforce program modularity.</li>
<li>Be easy to use.</li>
<li>Generate design documents easily understood by others.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is, in fact, a hierarchy of design tools required for a large project. 
At the outset, we must define the software architecture and the data flow 
between elements. This paper concerns itself with the next level – the 
detailed design of a program module.</p>
<p> The classical <strong>flow chart</strong> used for program design has many shortcomings, 
the greatest being its extreme flexibility. Any imaginable structure can 
be represented by a flow chart; hence, desirable structures cannot be 
enforced. Furthermore, arbitrarily large programs can be designed, defeating 
any attempt at modularity. Have you ever tried following a flow chart 
from page three via an off-page connector to page 17, then back to page 
10? And the code is as bad!</p>
<p> Our choice for an excellent tool which has proven its worth on dozens 
of large projects is the <strong>Nassi-Shneiderman</strong>, or N/S chart, named for I. 
Nassi and B. Shneiderman, who published this technique in 1982. (some 
may recognise these as Chapin charts.)</p>
<p>The N/S chart starts with the basic characterization of modern day languages 
as being <i>block-structured</i> languages. In these languages, procedures 
are blocks as shown in Figure 1. A block has a beginning and an end. When 
the procedure is called, or when the process is entered, instruction execution 
begins at the beginning (or top) of the block and proceeds to the end 
(or bottom) of the block.</p>

<h2>Sequential Statements</h2>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Figure 1</b></p>
<p> Figure 1 shows the simplest block. It simply contains a sequence of 
instructions.</p>
<p> The conditional IF structure is shown in Figure 2. At the top of the 
block is a conditional test. Depending upon the outcome of the test, one 
of two paths are taken through the block. If X equals Y, procedure A is 
executed. If X does not equal Y, procedure B is executed. In either case, 
control is passed to the top of the block and falls to the bottom of the 
block.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Figure 2</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText> Figures 3 and 4 show the WHILE-DO and DO-UNTIL structures. 
These are similar except that the WHILE-DO structure evaluates the condition 
first before executing the procedure, and the DO-UNTIL structure executes 
the procedure first and then evaluates the condition. In Figure 3, if 
X is not equal to Y, procedure A is executed; otherwise, control passes 
through the block. In Figure 4, procedure A is executed, and then the 
condition is evaluated. If X is not equal to Y, then the procedure is 
re-executed; otherwise, control passes from the block.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Figure 4</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText> The FOR  structure in Figure 5 executes the procedure 
A repetitively over a specified range of the variable X. Entering the 
block from the top causes the first value of X to be chosen, and A is 
evaluated relative to that value for X. When A completes, control is returned 
to the top of the block where the next value of X is chosen. When all 
values of X have been exhausted, control passes from the block.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Figure 5</b></p>
<p> The CASE structure is shown in Figure 6. The variable X is tested. If 
its value is 1, 2 or 3, the procedures A, B, or C, respectively, are executed. 
Otherwise, procedure D is executed.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Figure 6</b></p>
<p>Note that not only are all these structures representable as blocks but 
their sub-elements are also blocks. These sub-elements may themselves 
be any of the allowable block structures. The structures shown in Figures 
1 through 6 are only the most common ones. Though they are sufficient, 
other structures may be defined for a particular project.</p>
<p> Let us consider a simple example of an N/S representation of a program. 
A server named MSGAB must service a queue of messages. There are but two 
types of messages, A and B, to be processed by the procedures MSGA and 
MSGB, respectively. Once given control, the server processes all messages, 
if any, in its queue. If there are no messages, then the server must return 
an “I’m Alive” message to indicate to the calling procedure that it is 
still operational. Before exiting, it updates statistics. One exception 
condition is the receipt of an erroneous message type (not A or B). In 
this case an error message is returned and processing of further messages 
is terminated.</p>
<p> The N/S chart for this server is shown in Figure 7. It comprises three 
main blocks. The first one initializes various parameters in the program. 
The second one performs the message processing. The third block updates 
statistics.</p>
<p> The message processing block checks to see if there are any messages 
in the queue. If not, an “I’m Alive” message is sent. If the queue contains 
messages, their message types are analyzed via a case statement which 
calls the appropriate message processing routine (MSGA or MSGB). If an 
erroneous message type is found, an error message is sent and an exit 
is made from the server.</p>
<p> Note that three new notations have been introduced:</p>
<p>&nbsp;The procedure or process name is indicated at the top of the chart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Called procedures are noted with asterisks (e.g., *MSGA*).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The EXIT operator is an implied transfer of control to the bottom 
of the block, thus terminating the procedure or process.</p>

N/S Example </div>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Figure 7</b></p>
<p>In this example, the nesting of structure is clearly shown in the message 
processing block. This block is an IF structure which contains a DO-WHILE 
structure which contains a CASE structure.</p>
<p> The power of N/S charts as a design tool useful for controlling the 
quality of a design group can be appreciated by noting the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A procedure can have only one entry point (the top) and only one exit 
point (the bottom).</li>
<li>No 'off-page' connectors exist, so the program is forced to be modular. 
Large procedures simply cannot be represented. They must be organized 
into control structures which call other procedures.</li>
<li>Only acceptable structures can be used.</li>
<li>Nesting of structures is limited by how sharp your pencil is.It is difficult to draw IF statements nested 11 deep.</li>
<li>There is no way to represent a GOTO, so ' GOTO-less' coding is assured. (The 
EXIT operator is the only case of a very limited use of GOTO in some languages.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Structured coding proceeds pleasantly and effortlessly from these charts. 
Whereas (in Nassi and Shneiderman’s words) “the translation from flow 
chart to computer program is a one to many relationship whose output ranges 
over programs only some of which are legible, concise and efficient,” 
N/S charts give rise to code that is quite consistent in its content and 
quality.</p>
In these days of being tied to the keyboard, no tool is adequate unless 
it can be automated at the developer’s desktop. Fortunately there is an 
excellent NS tool that is even integrated with Word, allowing NS charts 
to be treated as objects in a Word document. One simply types in the pseudo 
code for the desired NS chart, and out comes a pleasantly constructed chart. 
This tool is available from Kast Associates (bobk@legato.com).Using this 
tool, the previous example would be represented by the following pseudo 
code: 
<p>Initialize<br />
<b>IF</b> Message_To_Process <b>THEN</b><br />
<b>WHILE</b> Message_Queue_Not_Empty <b>DO</b><br />
<b>SWITCH</b> Message_Type;<br />
<b>CASE</b> A;<br />
*MSGA*<br />
<b>CASE</b> B;<br />
*MSGB*<br />
<b>CASE Other</b>;<br />
Send_Error_Message<br />
<b>Exit</b><br />
<b>EXIT</b><br />
<b>END</b><br />
<b>END</b><br />
<b>ELSE</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Send_I'm_Alive_Message<br />
<b>END</b><br />
Update_Statistics</p>
<p>A click on a button yields the following NS Chart: </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align=center>
<tr> 
<td ><img width=336 height=265 src= "../m/nassi-shneiderman-image009.gif" /></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Thus, N/S charts represent a valuable design tool to enforce structure 
and modularity and to insure a consistent quality of design throughout 
a programming organization. In addition, these charts present an easily 
understandable depiction of data flow to the non-designers – the programmers 
and the users – and as such form an invaluable basis for maintenance documentation.</p>

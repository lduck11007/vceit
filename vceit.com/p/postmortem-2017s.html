 </p>
 <p><br />
   Modern Bus Services (MBS) has approached the state government to run a demand-responsive transport (DRT) system in a new, expanding residential area currently not serviced by public transport. The company runs traditional bus services in other areas, but feels that a traditional service will not be economical in this area. The government sees the potential of this new concept and has approved a pilot program based on MBS's proposal.</p>
 <p>   The DRT system will be cheaper for passengers than a taxi or other single-use vehicle, but will be more costly than a traditional bus ride.<br />
   The service will commence with three minibuses, but more can be added quickly if the demand is above what is expected. The plan is to use 20-seat luxury minibuses.<br />
   </p>
 <p>The advantages of the proposal are as follows:<br />
   1. door-to-door service<br />
   2. pick-up close to the time requested (no fixed timetable)<br />
   3. lower cost than similar single-user services, such as taxis<br />
   4. luxury facilities<br />
   5. reliability, as the DRT system will be run by a well-established company </p>
 <p>Now, the software solution needs to be designed and implemented.<br />
   The proposed DRT system will consist of a:<br />
   &bull; central computer at the minibus depot<br />
   &bull; mobile tablet in each minibus.<br />
   Each minibus will also be fitted with a Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor to provide its exact location at all times.<br />
   </p>
 <p>The central computer:<br />
   &bull; collects location data generated from satellites via the GPS sensor<br />
   &bull; sends traffic requests to the Roads Department<br />
   &bull;  receives traffic warnings and notifications of delays to assist with computing the most efficient route<br />
   &bull;  works out the route required for the minibus to pick up passengers<br />
   &bull; computes pick-up times<br />
   &bull; sends credit card details and payment amounts to the bank when a passenger's account is low<br />
   &bull; gets payment confirmation from the bank when the account is topped up.</p>
 <p><br />
   <strong>Registering</strong><br />
   To use the DRT system, passengers will be required to install an application on their mobile device. Passengers will register an account within the system and set up their method of payment. Payment will be deducted from the passenger's account, which will be set up through the application at the time of registration.</p>
 <p>   To register, passengers will be required to supply the following information to MBS:<br />
   &bull; name<br />
   &bull; billing address and postal address<br />
   &bull; email address<br />
   &bull; payment information</p>
 <p>   Options for payment will include:<br />
   &bull; depositing money into an MBS account<br />
   &bull; registering for direct debit or credit card payment.<br />
   Each registered passenger will then be provided with a unique passenger number and password for future transactions.<br />
   <br />
   <strong>Booking</strong><br />
   Passengers will use the application on their mobile device to contact MBS and make a booking. All locations must be within a defined area.<br />
   When booking a minibus, the passenger will provide the following information:<br />
   &bull; time<br />
   &bull; date<br />
   &bull; location for the pick up<br />
   &bull; location for the drop off<br />
   &bull; passenger number (which will automatically be added)<br />
   </p>
 <p>As passengers make bookings, the central computer will ensure that each booking does not increase the total travel time by more than five minutes or cause overcrowding on that trip. If these conditions cannot be met, passengers will be booked on the next minibus.<br />
   </p>
 <p>Using the given data, the central computer will generate a route map for each minibus and send it through to the relevant vehicle's on-board tablet.<br />
   When the booking is complete, the application will give the passenger an approximate pick-up time and produce a route map.<br />
   </p>
 <p>After each completed trip, passenger feedback will be sought via the application. Passengers will be able to rate the drive, the condition of the minibus and the timeliness of each trip. This will enable MBS to continually monitor the service and to make improvements where necessary.<br />
   </p>
 <p>Logan and Riya from Grommet Computer Services (GCS) have been selected by MBS to develop the software solution and install all hardware that MBS will need to implement the DRT system.<br />

   Once a passenger is logged in to the MBS application, they must complete the 'Create booking' procedure. On completion of the 'Create booking' procedure, the passenger has the option to 'Purchase headphones', which come at an additional cost but can be used to listen to a series of pre-tuned radio stations on the minibus throughout the journey.<br />
   If the passenger's plans change, it is possible to 'Modify booking' or 'Delete booking' up to 12 hours prior to the journey. In order to modify a booking, the passenger must use the 'Search existing bookings' function and select the booking that they wish to modify. If a passenger wishes to use the 'Delete booking' feature, they can do so through 'Modify booking'.<br />

     Sophie works in the IT Department of MBS and is responsible for the project management and rollout of the DRT system. Several months ago, her team launched a website that allows potential passengers of the DRT system to register their details, including name, phone number and address, so that they can receive updates on the rollout of the DRT system.<br />
     Sophie wants to recruit many interested passengers so that when the DRT system goes live, it will already have many potential passengers. However, Sophie is concerned about keeping the collected passenger data safe and private.<br />
     Describe one action, other than physical security methods, that could be used to secure passenger data.</p>

       As a first step, Logan starts to plan the project and decides to use three separate teams to develop the DRT system. He estimates that it will take 25 days to write, test and debug the software needed on the central computer. It will take 15 days to write, test and debug the software needed on the tablet on the bus and 20 days to write, test and debug the application that will be on the passengers' mobile devices. It will take 10 days to install the software and hardware, and test if the central computer can communicate with the passengers' mobile devices and with the tablet in the bus and its associated GPS sensor. It will take a further five days to test the DRT system.<br />

Question 8 (9 marks)<br />
       When a passenger makes a booking, they need to have enough money in their account (accountbalance) to pay for the fare or have given MBS permission to automatically top up their balance from a nominated credit card (topup = true). If neither of these conditions is met, then the booking is refused and a 'low balance' message is sent to the passenger.<br />
       The following pseudocode is used to check these conditions.</p>

Question 11 (3 marks)<br />
       On the whole, the project has run smoothly, with the exception of the cost of the outsourced interfaces being higher than was originally anticipated.<br />
       Jeff is the lead technical officer at LCS (an information marketing firm) and he has approached Riya with the proposition that MBS agree to sell their database of prospective passengers in return for a sum of money. Jeff says that passengers' details will be used for advertising purposes in different projects run by LCS and that there is no way that any of the passengers will find out that it was MBS who provided their information.<br />
       Riya is concerned that such actions would be illegal, but she is not sure which legislation applies or why.<br />
       Identify one piece of legislation that could potentially be breached if the proposition were accepted and justify your choice.<br />

     Riya is concerned about the possibility of MBS suffering from a cyber attack due to the fact that the DRT system will be online to mobile devices and will contain large amounts of sensitive data.<br />
     Riya proposes a number of actions to help protect the DRT system. She suggests that a physical firewall be installed in the head office to help protect the central computer from attacks over the internet.<br />

       MBS expects large amounts of data to be created every day. For example, each request to make a booking will create GPS data, data from the generation of the optimum route and data from the bank. Some of the data will only be required for a short period of time, while other data will be more stable and change less frequently.<br />
       </p>
     <p align="left">a. Suggest a backup strategy that could be used to back up frequently changing data and more stable data. Give reasons for your suggestion.<br />

Question 14 (2 marks)<br />
       Once the DRT system is running, it is noted that passengers regularly enter a house number that does not exist in a given street. Data about the lowest and highest house number is known to the DRT system and the house number entered by the passenger must fall between these. GCS decides to add some code so that the passenger is prompted when an invalid house number is entered.<br />

       Logan has developed a number of evaluation criteria to measure the effectiveness of the software solution developed for the DRT system. Two of these criteria are as follows:<br />
       1. All passengers are to be picked up within five minutes of the requested time.<br />
       2. Passenger satisfaction is to be gauged by the number of repeat bookings.<br />
       Outline a strategy for evaluating each criterion.<br />
